                        A software engineer currently based in the Greater Vancouver Area in Canada.
                        Software Engineering has taught me a lot about how to get things done and life in general as well.
                        I am also interested in a host of other things, from science and spirituality to sports and comedy.

                        I am a software engineer with over 10 years of experience working in multiple business domains and locations.
                        I have worked in big and small companies, and hence, able to thrive in different environments.<br/>
                        I have done full-stack work but focussed more on the backend, setup infrastructure, written automation and integration tests, created dashboards and alarms, been on-call, perfomed project planning, code-reviews, blameless investigations of incidents, and handled communications.
                        I have worked on performance optimization of software applications as well as improving the UI/UX.
                        I like to learn new technologies and areas of work in order to pragmattically get things done. I learned React to build this website (<Link href="https://github.com/aqib-bhat/aqibmedes" target="_blank" rel="noopener" underline="hover">GtHub repo</Link>)<br/>
                        I have been been a part of, and lead small and big projects. I get involved in all aspects of software engineering from understanding the business domain and synthesizing requirements to making the developer experience better and ensuring the sound monitoring of systems.
                        I like to take ownership while building good relationships. I have myself implemented software services as well as handled the testing and DevOps/SRE aspects, and so, coordinating with the Product/QA/DevOps/SRE/Other teams and customers is something that I do in a prompt and respectful way.
                        I like to ensure that things are made clear, and good principles are applied in a balanced way so that everyone from a newcomer to an experienced person, the on-call engineer to the customer, all have a delightful experience.<br/>
